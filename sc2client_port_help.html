	<h1>How do I setup client port?</h1>
	<p>If you are using battle.net client, open it, go to Starcraft 2 settings<p>
	<img src="./images/blizzard_apps_sc2_settings.jpg" />
	<p>Scroll down to Starcraft 2 command line options, and add the following line</p>
	<p>-clientapi 127.0.0.1:6120</p>
	<p>If you already have other command options in the textbox, insert the line above in the front and put a space after it</p>
	<p>Make sure "Additional command line arguments" is checked</p>

	<p>If you are using desktop shortcut insead of battle.net client, go to shortcut options and add the same line to the shortcut's target</p>
	<img src="./images/sc2_shortcut.png" />
	<p>Run Starcraft 2, and while Starcraft is running, open the following link in your web-browser</p>
	<a href="http://localhost:6120/ui">http://localhost:6120/ui</a>
	<p>If everything is all right, you should see web-page with some brackets, and possibly some words between them</p>
	<img src="./images/localhost_sc2_ui.png" />
	<p>In this case, you should see "Connected" status in the application window. Just make sure that the number in "Starcraft 2 client port" field matches the number we used above (i.e. 6120)</p>
	<p>If you see brackets in web-browser but the application cannot connect to Starcraft 2 client, please check your firewall settings</p>
	<p>If you see "Page not found" in your web-browser, it could be because some other application already uses the port 6120. Just pick another port number in range from 5000 to 65000 and redo all the steps</p>
